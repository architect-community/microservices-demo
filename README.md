**Online Boutique** is a cloud-native microservices demo application.
Online Boutique consists of a 10-tier microservices application. The application is a
web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.

**Google uses this application to demonstrate use of technologies like
Kubernetes/GKE, Istio, Stackdriver, gRPC and OpenCensus**. This application
works on any Kubernetes cluster (such as a local one), as well as Google
Kubernetes Engine. Itâ€™s **easy to deploy with little to no configuration**.

## Service Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of many microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

| [currencyservice](./src/currencyservice)             | Node.js       | Converts one money amount to another currency. Uses real values fetched from European Central Bank. It's the highest QPS service. |
| [paymentservice](./src/paymentservice)               | Node.js       | Charges the given credit card info (mock) with the given amount and returns a transaction ID.                                     |
| [shippingservice](./src/shippingservice)             | Go            | Gives shipping cost estimates based on the shopping cart. Ships items to the given address (mock)                                 |

## Features

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/):**
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for
  Desktop", as well as on the cloud with GKE).
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):** Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to
  communicate to each other.
- **[Istio](https://istio.io):** Application works on Istio service mesh.
- **[OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/) Tracing:** Most services are
  instrumented using OpenCensus trace interceptors for gRPC/HTTP.
- **[Stackdriver APM](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/):** Many services
  are instrumented with **Profiling**, **Tracing** and **Debugging**. In
  addition to these, using Istio enables features like Request/Response
  **Metrics** and **Context Graph** out of the box. When it is running out of
  Google Cloud, this code path remains inactive.
- **[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev):** Application
  is deployed to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.
- **Synthetic Load Generation:** The application demo comes with a background
  job that creates realistic usage patterns on the website using
  [Locust](https://locust.io/) load generator.

## Installation

We offer the following installation methods:

1. **Running locally** (~20 minutes) You will build and deploy locally via Architect.

2. **Running remotely** (~10 minutes) You will deploy remotely to the Architect Cloud.

### Prerequisites

This project uses [Architect](https://architect.io) to deploy and manage our services simultaneously. Install Architect's CLI to deploy the services:

```bash
$ npm install -g @architect-io/cli
```

### Option 1: Running locally

> ðŸ’¡ Recommended if you're planning to develop the application or giving it a try.

```bash
$ architect link ./src/cartservice/architect.yml
$ architect link ./architect.yml
$ architect deploy --local examples/boutique:latest --interface shop:frontend
```
Once the application is done booting, the shop will be available on http://shop.localhost/

### Option 2: Running remotely

> ðŸ’¡ Recommended if you're using Architect Cloud and want to try it on a real cluster.
